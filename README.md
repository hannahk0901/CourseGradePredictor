# CourseGradePredictor (iGradeU)

## 📌 Overview
**CourseGradePredictor** (also called *iGradeU*) is an AI-powered academic foresight tool designed to reduce stress, uncertainty, and guesswork in education.  
Students often misjudge their abilities—some are overconfident and underprepare, while others struggle with imposter syndrome and underperform despite strong skills. Traditional feedback also comes too late, often only after exams or projects, leaving little room for improvement.  

Our solution provides **instant, personalized insights** by predicting a student’s likely grade in a course and identifying their strengths and growth areas.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Canvas API Integration**  
   - Securely pulls assignment weights, grades, and performance trends.  
   - Categorizes assignments into projects, exams, homework, and participation.  

2. **RateMyProfessor Insights**  
   - Adds external data on professor ratings, difficulty levels, and teaching style.  

3. **Syllabus Intelligence (NLP)**  
   - Uses OpenAI to parse syllabi and extract course expectations into standardized categories.  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Synthesizes Canvas data, RateMyProfessor ratings, and syllabus insights to forecast the student’s final grade.  

5. **Feedback Engine**  
   - Highlights individual strengths (e.g., strong exams) and weaknesses (e.g., project skills).  
   - Provides actionable recommendations to improve performance before it’s too late.
